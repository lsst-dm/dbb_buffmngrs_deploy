Overview
========

Data Backbone (DBB) buffer managers consist of two separate managers:
**handoff** and **endpoint**.  The handoff manager is  responsible for
transferring files from a **handoff site** to an **endpoint site**.  The
endpoint buffer manager is responsible for ingesting the files into the DBB.

.. _section-handoff:

DBB handoff buffer manager
==========================

.. _section-handoff-download:

Download deployment scripts
---------------------------

Recommended way of deploying DBB handoff buffer manager is with Docker
container.  You can download scripts which help you build and run such a
container from GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/lsst-dm/dbb_buffmngrs_deploy .
   cd dbb_buffmngrs_deploy

.. _section-handoff-configuration:

Configure DBB handoff buffer manager
------------------------------------

In ``docker/dbb_buffmngrs_handoff/buffmngr.yml``, in **endpoint** section you
need to specify three directories:  

1. **staging area**: directory where the files are being transferred to,
2. **storage area**: directory where the files will be moved after transfer is
   complete,
3. **buffer**: directory used by the manager,

as well as

4. **host**: the name of the host acting as the endpoint site,
5. **user**: a user account to use for file transfer (the manger uses
   internally ``scp`` to transfer files between the sites, so anonymous
   transfer is not supported).

.. warning::

   The selected user needs to have passwordless login enabled on the endpoint
   site.  
   
.. note:: 

   Only *handoff* and *endpoint* sections are strictly required to be present
   in the configuration file.  However, enabling logging to a file (by default
   DBB handoff buffer manager outputs log messages on stdout/stderr) is highly
   recommended. You can achieve it by specifying **file** option in **logging**
   section, for example:

   .. code-block::
   
      logging:
        file: /var/log/lsst/handoff.log

   Keep in mind though that in order to easily view the log file outside of the
   container, you need to bind mount a writable directory from the host machine
   to that location (see :ref:`section-handoff-mounts` for details).

.. _section-handoff-building:

Build the image
---------------

#. Select desired version of LSST stack and DBB handoff buffer manager in
   ``etc/handoff.conf`` by modifying respectively ``STACK_VER`` and
   ``MANAGER_VER``. 

#. Select a user which will be used to run the manager within the Docker
   container by adjusting ``USER`` variable.  This user needs to have a
   read/write access to the buffer, holding area, and the directory where the
   log file will be written to.

#. Build the Docker image with

   .. code:: bash

      ./bin/build_buffmngr.sh

.. _section-handoff-mounts:

Adjust bind mounts
------------------

There is a helping script, ``bin/start_buffmngr.sh``, available in the
repository you cloned allowing you to start the container with minimum effort.
However, before you can use it, you need to adjust bind mounts which enables
the DDB handoff buffer manager running inside of the container to interact with
filesystems necessary to do its job. These are:

* the buffer and the holding area,
* log directory (usually ``/var/log``),
* directory with SSH keys (usually ``~/.ssh``).

Make sure these bind mounts reflect your setup.

.. _section-handoff-starting:

Start the container
-------------------

Once you correct the bind mount, you can start the container with

.. code-block:: bash

   ./bin/start_buffmngr.sh

.. _section-endpoint:

DBB endpoint buffer manager
===========================

Currently package `ctrl_oods`_ implementing Observatory Operation Data Service
(OODS) is used to emulate functionality of DBB endpoint buffer manager.

.. _ctrl_oods: https://github.com/lsst-dm/ctrl_oods

.. _section-endpoint-download:

Download and install DBB endpoint buffer manager
------------------------------------------------

Create a directory where you want to install DBB endpoint buffer manager. For
example:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p lsstsw/addons
   cd lsstsw/addons

Download ``ctrl_oods`` by cloning its repository from GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/lsst-dm/ctrl_oods .
   cd ctrl_oods

Make sure you selected the required version of ``ctrl_oods``:

.. code-block:: bash

   git checkout 1.0.0-rc1

.. warning::

   Newer implementations of OODS use messaging system which is not supported by
   DBB buffer manager and won't work with it!

Set it up and build with

.. code-block:: bash

   setup -r .
   scons

.. _section-endpoint-testing:

Test DBB endpoint buffer manager
--------------------------------

After youâ€™ve installed DBB endpoint buffer manager, you can run ``oods.py
--help`` to check if the installation was successful and see its usage.

.. _section-endpoint-configuration:

Configure DBB endpoint buffer manager
-------------------------------------

DBB endpoint buffer manager comes with an example configuration file,
``etc/oods.yaml``.  However, you can't use it without making few adjustments.

Firstly, you need to provide the location of the buffer and Gen2 repo in the
*ingester* section (here ``/data/buffer`` and ``/data/gen2repo`` respectively).

.. code-block::

   ingester:
     directories:
       - /data/buffer
     butler:
       class:
         import : lsst.ctrl.oods.gen2ButlerIngester
         name : Gen2ButlerIngester
         repoDirectory: /data/gen2repo
       batchSize: 20
       scanInterval:
         <<: *interval
         seconds: 10

.. note::

   ``scanInterval`` indicates how often the manager will scan the buffer for
   new files.  While it's not required, you may set it to value you consider
   reasonable in your case.  You should left other options unchanged, unless
   you know what you're doing.

Finally, you need to disable file cleaner. You can achieve this by creating an
empty directory

.. code-block::

   mkdir /tmp/empty

and updating *cacheCleaner* section accordingly

.. code-block::

   cacheCleaner:
     directories:
       - /tmp/empty
     scanInterval:
       <<: *interval
       seconds: 30
     filesOlderThan:
       <<: *interval
       days: 30 
     directoriesEmptyForMoreThan:
       <<: *interval
       days: 1

.. note::

   For initial version of the manager, the intent is to use OODS "as is".
   However, OODSs' goal is slightly different comparing to DBB ingest service.
   As a result, it removes periodically files it considers obsolete from the
   Gen2 repo.  This "workaround" will not be necessary in the future.

.. _section-dbbis-setup:

Set up DBB endpoint buffer manager
----------------------------------

Before you can start DBB endpoint buffer manager, you need to set up LSST stack
and ``ctrl_oods``.  

Let the locations where the stack and ``ctrl_oods`` are installed be defined by
environmental variables ``LSSTSW`` and ``ADDONSW`` respectively, e.g.,

.. code-block::

   export LSSTSW="/software/lsstsw/stack"
   export ADDONSW="/software/lsstsw/addons"

Then you can set LSST stack up with

.. code-block::

   source ${LSSTSW}/loadLSST.bash
   setup lsst_distrib
   # or setup lsst_distrib -t <tag, e.g., w_2020_09>

If needed, setup other special versions of packages, e.g., 

.. code-block::

   setup -j obs_lsst -t <tag>
   # or cd /to/my/build/of/package; setup -j -r .

Finally, set up ``ctrl_oods`` itself

.. code-block::

   setup -j -r ${ADDONSW}/ctrl_oods

.. note::

   For conveniece, you may want to set ``LSSTSW`` and ``ADDONSW`` variables in
   your ``.bashrc`` and then run ``source ~/.bashrc`` or open a new terminal
   for changes to take effect.

.. _section-endpoint-running:

Start DBB endpoint buffer manager
---------------------------------

The repository you cloned contains a helping script, ``bin/start_oods.sh``
which simplifies starting DBB endpoint buffer manager.  Copy it to a location
searched by shell for executables (e.g. ``$HOME/bin`` on Centos)

.. code-block::

   cp bin/start_oods.sh $HOME/bin

Then you can start DBB ingest service with

.. code-block::

   start_oods.sh oods.yaml
   
where ``oods.yaml`` is the configuration file you prepared in :ref:`previous
step <section-dbbis-configuration>`.

.. note::

   By default, the all messages are logged to ``/var/log/oods.log``. You can
   changed the defult location using ``-l`` option. Run ``start_oods.sh -h``
   for help.
